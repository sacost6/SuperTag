CS 342 Project 5

This project was written using Node.JS and Phaser for a Software Design class as an end of semester project. In this project, 
I chose to teach myself JavaScript and write the final project in that language. The game is very basic, each client is represented as a ball on the screen, belonging to the team of its color. The way to win is to collect the most items that 
drop on the screen.
